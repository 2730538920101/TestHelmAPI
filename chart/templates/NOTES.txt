Congratulations! Your chart has been deployed.

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the chart:**

   Ensure your `.env` file includes the following variables:
   ```
   API_SERVER=http://backend-service.helm-test.svc.cluster.local:5000/api
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Add the provided `deploy.sh` script to the root directory of the chart.**
   This script automates the deployment process using Helm.

3. **Run the deployment:**

   First, ensure the script has execution permissions:
   ```
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```

   Then execute the script:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

### Access the Frontend Service

Once the deployment is complete, follow these steps to access the frontend service:

1. **Retrieve the external IP:**
   ```
   kubectl get svc frontend-service -n {{ .Values.namespace }}
   ```

2. **Open the service in your browser:**
   ```
   http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
   ```

   Replace `<EXTERNAL-IP>` with the value retrieved from the command above.

### Additional Notes

- If you encounter issues, verify that your `.env` file is correctly configured and that the `deploy.sh` script is in the root directory of the chart.
- For troubleshooting, you can simulate the deployment without applying changes by running:
  ```
  ./deploy.sh 
  ```

Enjoy your deployment with Helm!
